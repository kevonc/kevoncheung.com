In this post, I want to share the behind-the-scenes thinking of why I scrapped the revenue streams. If you're a new creator, I think you'll be able to relate! 💪 Which product was working? 30DaysInPublic, the 30-day cohort-based challenge, was my first course product. I ran a total of 3 cohorts and iterated the content each time. In the 3rd cohort in Jul 2021, it made $1,868. Honestly, it wasn't bad at all! 🙌"

        "before": "Is this the best way to provide an awesome experience? For example, there are many ways to teach Building in Public, does it have to be a 30-day challenge? What am I good at? I learned that I enjoy teaching & sharing more than facilitating community engagement like mastermind groups. What's the scalability of a product? Can a live-teaching course scale like a video course? But can a video course attract as many people as a cohort-based course? All these are important. Okay, so here are why I stopped running 30DaysInPublic (the 30-day challenge making $1,868 in July) and charging for my community (making $267.5 in August). I stopped running 30DaysInPublic It was absolutely a fantastic time pulling together a group of people together each month to do this.",
        "after": "I knew I could have grown it by increasing the price or getting more students, but I needed to fix one thing first. And that is the experience design. One thing new course creators might not know is that there is no perfect course format . We believe there must be a framework that can yield good learning experience, but the reality is that you have to figure out what works best for your topic and your students. When I put together 30DaysInPublic, it was the classic \"Move fast and break things\" mindset - kudos to my startup experience."

Even though some students would come to me and said the 30 days challenge was good and game-changing for them, I knew I should take a pause, revisit what I learned, and create a better course. It is also why I'm part of the Maven Course Accelerator to improve my course design and facilitation skills. I stopped collecting recurring membership fee",
        "after": "I announced to my 50 paid members that I would no longer charge them a recurring fee in order to be part of the Public Lab community. They can still be part of the community on Slack and email list, and I'll still be running AMAs with entrepreneurs. The only difference is they don't need to pay an ongoing fee. Of course, it is only a $267.5MRR decision (not a lot), but is still a big decision on my part given it is the only recurring revenue. The decision comes down to 3 reasons: 🤝 Community Value ‍"

I don't want that. The community's mission, ongoing activities, and member engagement should be carefully designed and executed to be worth a recurring fee. For Public Lab, since I realized my strength and interest is more in creating content and courses, the community should become a supporting part of my offering. And it shouldn't have a recurring fee attached. 🙌 Supporters ‍",
        "after": "I know for a fact that many of them have been supporting my work even though they're not looking for a particular value in return. They're happy to pay even if they only participate once or twice a month. This is encouraging and I'm super grateful for this - they are really my so-called \"Super Fans\" . But at the same time, it feels strange. A one-off fee to support feels alright, but an ongoing fee to support feels uncomfortable to me. I don't know who is there to support and who is there waiting for value, and I don't want a transaction to be in the mix of a genuine relationship."
