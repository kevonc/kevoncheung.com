I realized there were a ton of mistakes we made: didn’t specify a specific market segment where the early adopters are, didn’t test assumptions and pivot enough, and didn’t come up with a way to present our product effectively when meeting with clients. The sponsorship space is definitely a tough market to go into, but we could have been more successful in tackling the problems if we had used the lean startup concept.",
        "after": "Well, other than learning the startup methodology, I also visited a ton of places in Singapore, Night Safari, Garden by the Bay, Sentosa, Raffle Places, Clarke Quay, the best rooftop bar 1-Altitude , Little India, Orchard Road, Bugis, what a shame I didn’t get to Chinatown lol! I found Singapore to be a very lovely place, it is extremely small but ridiculously diverse, from Indians to Chinese to Malays to Westerners, you could expect everything there. From the riverside bars in Clarke Quay and Raffle Places to the outdoor ones on Orchard Road, I could say working short-term in Singapore is totally preferable to Hong Kong, but in terms of living permanently, I’m not too sure because things to do will run out pretty soon."
