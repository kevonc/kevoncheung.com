        "after": "How am I feeling? Stepping into August, I'm feeling a little anxious and uncertain as the year is counting down, but at the same time, I've learned a ton in July about course design and positioning that are utterly critical to my next few months. Actually, I've not been more confident about hitting my 2021 goal now that I've found that a kick-ass course is my way to get there! Also, someone told me \"Kevon, you have to go faster! Take back some of your venture-backed mindset previously!\" When I heard that, I wasn't sure how to react. I've come to like my current approach which is slow and mindful. I know I'm not hustling super hard (like working faster and only getting 4 hours of sleep each day) but I think I can do this for a long time. More importantly, I see that things are progressing steadily."

More importantly, I see that things are progressing steadily. How is my personal life? It has been steady! Avery just turned 7 months ! We went for a baby fundamentals demo class because we don't want Avery to be stuck at home most of the week, and personal development is what we care about the most. We immediately signed up for a membership which gives Lydia and Avery 2 classes a week.",
        "after": "My relationship with Avery - she is dodging my kisses, always! Kidding ;) Lydia and I also took time for ourselves and went on a staycation. It was our first time leaving Avery for 24 hours to her grandparents. Was it scary? Not really, we trust the people around us so much! Building a support system is vital if you plan to have kids; there is no need to make our lives miserable when it is the best thing ever. We talked a lot about parenting principles. We saw how other kids behaved and we talked about our perspectives: how we want Avery to behave differently and how we can make that happen. I love how Lydia and I are able to communicate logically about principles, approaches, and systems in life."

Rethinking the Community Experience Up till this point, the Public Lab community is heavily presented as a forum. But this is not true!

Big one: redesigning my course I've learned a ton about course design in July. I first developed 30DaysInPublic with email prompts and short videos, making it very much like a self-paced course.

However, I have to focus on improving the product first. Since I'm not open for new sign-ups at the moment, such marketing optimization can wait. Debating over SEO I set out last month to spend more time on SEO, then later decided maybe in the short term I should double down on Twitter instead. It was a tough call and I'm sure many entrepreneurs struggle fighting short-term vs. long-term. I opened Google Search Console one day and was surprised to find a graph like this.",

Plan for August Most of my time will be dedicated to running the new cohort-based course. It is going to be a new course (not 30DaysInPublic) because the goal is different. For this course, I'm helping students find out their online brand positioning, identify their audience, and create a game plan to grow it with #BuildInPublic. I want this small group to be blown away by how far they can go! I'm ready to launch my first info product - the Building in Public action pack - on Gumroad! I'm excited as this is my first info product launch! I definitely want to get the community's help to get it out there."
