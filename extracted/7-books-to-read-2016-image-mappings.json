After reading Chris Guillebeau’s “How to Conduct Your Own Annual Review” , I came up with 14 measurable targets in the fields of Relationships (Family & Friends), Finance, Health, Learning, and Travel. I didn’t set a target for reading books because it is a no-brainer for me that I must and will read a lot. It is funny because I hated reading in my childhood, and now I treat books as one of my closest friends, so I spent some time making a list of books I would read in 2016. I hope you’ll find some of them interesting, and please also share with me what you’re reading!",

Review on Jan 27, 2016: Hmmm, I would not recommend this book at all, I stopped reading because of 2 main reasons. 1) After reading around different chapters, it seems to only talk about one message - why you should have a growth mindset, not a fixed mindset. Using a lot of small stories to bring out the same message, the book does feel like an infinite loop. 2) And the stories are not even interesting ……"

        "after": "Source: Amazon 7. When Breath Becomes Air By Paul Kalanithi Why? A close one of mine passed away from lung cancer 16 years ago. What does it feel like when you’re so close to death? I want to find out. Review on Feb 10, 2016: A strong recommendation. I don’t think a lot of people actually study death before it hits them, which is sad because a lot of times it could be too late. I like the book a lot because it carries us through his own life, the gains, and the struggles… it is very real, too real. You could feel the author’s perseverance in fighting for his life."
