Since I published the Building in Public Definitive Guide , I've been helping builders get over their fear to speak and share publicly on the Internet. I'm able to help because I've trained up myself emotionally over the years. 3 years ago, I was making lifestyle YouTube videos and shared them mainly with my Facebook and Instagram audience, which meant my family and friends. I've developed \"a thick skin\". When I ran my previous startup, I shot lots of videos and hosted many community gatherings. Through putting myself out there consistently, I've found a few tricks to help me overcome the fear."
