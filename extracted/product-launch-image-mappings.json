        "after": "Every founder has to learn how to launch products. If you do it well, your product gets a good start with testimonials, users, and sometimes even revenue on day 1. But to learn and understand how to do it right, you'll have to fail multiple times. I learned the hard way when I was running my venture-backed startup, Toasty, in 2019-2020. The Toasty story Let me quickly tell you the story so that you have a full picture of what happened. I was building this interactive technology for a crowd to use collectively at physical events. Then one day, COVID-19 hit and I was facing the decision to believe in our original vision or to pivot. As there was no way we could return to running physical events shortly, I chose the latter."

        "before": "Back at Toasty, we were pressured into a new environment to build a new product. We had a vision but nothing else. We went straight into building because we had the engineers and designers. Reflecting on how I created the guide and the email course, the first thing I did was to immerse myself in the community and observe. I paid extra attention to what people talked about, where they needed help, and which of my tweets or articles were doing well. Here were the breadcrumbs that led me to build Making Twitter Friends . There is no shortage of courses on growing Twitter, and I keep seeing more. As my Twitter circle gets bigger, I know that the demand is there.",
        "after": "There are lots and lots of courses on Growing Twitter. I haven't taken any of these courses. But, a lot of them seem to focus on the mechanics. What I'm more interested in is how to be personal, make friends, and build relationships. Growing for the sake of growth doesn't interest me. I wrote an article on growing Twitter using human psychology and I could tell from the page views and subscriber number that people enjoy it very much. All these data points gave me signals about a potential opportunity. It wasn't 100% validation (as there is no such thing), but I was confident enough that my products would at least benefit a group of people."

Never launch the day the product is done If your plan is to focus on building and then put it out there when it is done, you're doomed. At Toasty, we built, we launched, and we got nothing. The way I created the guide and the email course was very different. I've been using Twitter to make friends and my tweets became my testing ground. Long before my guide was ready, I already talked about it and received interest from people.",

Dan ( @DanRoche01 ) was super helpful. Boris ( @BorisTane ) was giving me a hand. Pavel ( @hipavel ) even helped read my draft for both part 1 & 2. They liked the idea and were willing to help, so I took the opportunity to bring them in as early readers. I didn't do that to create exclusivity. I was more interested in getting early feedback to improve the product before it hit the big stage."

When we learned English, we started picking up the alphabet, then vocabulary, then grammar, and then syntax. Learning always starts from the simplest form. Then, what made me think that I could make a big jump to build a venture-backed startup in my early entrepreneurial journey?"
