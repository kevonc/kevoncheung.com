Despite a pretty awful June month in terms of numbers, I'm feeling extra hopeful because of what's coming up in July and my overall progress. 6 more months to get to my goal of $5,000 monthly revenue in Dec 2021.

Mini products like Making Twitter Friends or #30DaysInPublic Preview work well. What I'm not so sure about is quick video tips and blog posts on PublicLab.co . They're high effort but I haven't seen much payoff. My top funnel is weak Top funnel is where new people come in to learn about my work. Essentially, marketing is about attracting new people and convincing them that I can offer value. My numbers tell me that I should work on attracting more people to come in. Something I relied on a lot on Twitter so far.",
        "after": "My SEO game is not solid. You can see that my new blog posts are ranked 21-90 so far, I need to get them to the first page. I know how SEO works, but often I'm just grabbing the keyword with decent volume & low competition, and then writing a blog post around it. I'm not super technical in getting blog posts ranked. While it is not paying off yet, I strongly believe SEO is the way to go in the long run. So I need to study it more closely in July. Because even if I start doing things right, it takes time for SEO effects to kick in."

After all, Public Lab is all about Building in Public and people might be interested in my other offerings! Of course, I've been hesitant to migrate it because I might lose all the organic traffic from SEO. After asking for advice, I learned that doing 301 redirects will likely tell Google that this guide has a new home, and all will be fine. So I did it, and after about 16 days, I checked Google and it is ranking my new pages!"

I used to focus a lot on designing a \"collaborative whiteboard\" for the weekly call to make it a fruitful workshop. After hearing feedback, the part attendees enjoy the most are conversations with other attendees. That's when I knew the instructions didn't have to be fancy, and I just needed to give enough instructions to shape their conversations. Having fancy whiteboards can actually add overhead to a one-hour call. Started to build a Notion template",
        "after": "I've been working with builders on Building in Public for a while, and I've compiled a library of writing prompts and audience-building tactics. Because my two products (a cohort-based course and a community) both require a huge commitment, it is only attractive to a certain type of people who have the time and interest. If I want to achieve my goal of $5,000, I need to diversify my offering to include \"passive\" info products. Products that can be purchased and used anytime. Products that people are going to do impulse buying, like a book, a guide, or a template."

I have to be okay about that given the community is so small. I wanted to write a short guide on audience building. I had it outline but I haven't been able to write it. I still struggle with using Circle as a community platform vs Discord/Slack and even tweeted about it . Live chat platforms have this illusion that it is more engaging because of the new messages, but it easily becomes overwhelming for most people. I know the forum is the way to go for the long term because it encourages slow and thoughtful exchange, and that's what I want Public Lab to be. Plan for July 2021 Level up my #30DaysInPublic free preview nurturing funnel by figuring out the timeline and content to boost the interest to enroll Build and launch the Notion template. I would love it to blow people away and help them self-start building in public. Step up my SEO game and improve my process to write for the end results. I'm going to dedicate 2 hours a week to focus on SEO studying. Monday is the best day for that!",
