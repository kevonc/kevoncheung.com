        "after": "As a startup founder, you hear about SEO but all the articles out there are crazily technical. You want to know why you should care about SEO. And believe it or not. Most founders focus on products much more than marketing in the early days. This is because intuitively, we’re inclined to work out a solution before we drive traction. But this is not going to work in 2020. So this article is for first-time founders to understand the importance of doing marketing early and how SEO plays a key role in building up sustainable traction for you."

I wrote articles, I distributed them on Slack groups, I posted on social media, I bought ads, I ran campaigns to capture emails … It was difficult. With so much effort, we saw traffic going up steadily but slowly. Then one day, our blog traffic started to rise! And soon, it tripled month to month. Then it doubled and doubled again. What happened?",
        "after": "Source: Toasty Let’s break down the traffic At the start, no matter how hard we shared our articles, we got hundreds of views only (see Sep-Dec 2019). We pushed harder and achieved 3,000+ in Mar and Apr 2020, then we lost our junior marketer and stopped actively distributing. When SEO kicked in in Jul 2020, we grew solely on organic traffic due to a lack of manpower. This was a dream come true! More traffic meant we had a lot more room to run experiments, to grow our user base, and to improve our conversions!"
