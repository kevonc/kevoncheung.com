        "after": "I was chatting with a community builder friend and he asked me, \"What's the thing that offers the most value in your community?\" It took me a good 10 seconds to think about Public Lab , the Building in Public community I run, and I said \"So far, the AMA sessions!\" I went on to tell him that personally I almost never attended any AMA sessions myself, but because I can clearly see that my members enjoy them, I keep on inviting entrepreneurs who value authenticity and transparency to share with us."
