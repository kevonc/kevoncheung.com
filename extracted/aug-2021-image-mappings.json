This is exactly how I'm feeling. I've been running courses for 4 months. Now that they're over, I am building the next thing. I'd say this is a common feeling when you're new in a field and still learning the ropes, so I'm totally okay with it. At the same time, I'm aware that I need to stop the cycle of building â†’ done â†’ building â†’ done."

Most people think a community can be self-sustained where members will chat and ask questions freely, but this only happens in very few communities. Someone needs to actively start conversations and invite people to chip in. Currently, my expenses are sitting at 30.5% of revenue. I don't want to go above this percentage and that means I have to increase my revenue with my current resources! What important things happened Launched my 1st info product",
        "after": "Like most Internet products, sales for Use Twitter Meaningfully went up during the launch and then fell nearly flat. It's common. What is important after the launch is how to embed the offering inside the marketing funnel. Clearly, I haven't gotten to that stage yet! Here are my biggest learnings from the launch: Mini products like this rarely get a word-of-mouth effect. They're more revenue-generating products relying on existing credibility and channels. For someone starting out, I don't think they should work on mini products. A big product (book, course, big guide) that is so value-packed and priced right can generate more buzz and credibility. Of course, mini products are great for testing the demand Pricing is hard. I started with $9 and increased $3 for every 20 copies. And then eventually I set it at $18 going forward. I think this is a good strategy giving some sense of urgency during the launch period"

        "after": "Had an absolutely great time with this small group of 6. It was my 1st time running a cohort-based course live style where I taught live on Monday and then we discussed more live on Thursday. What I learned about courses: Cohort-based simply means there is a start date and end date with the group. The course design can vary based on the objective. There are topics that are better suited as self-paced where students take their time to learn and there are topics that are better suited as cohort-based where students learn and work together to improve. This all comes down to the course creator's experience in designing for impact. But - cohort-based courses donâ€™t mean live teaching! There is significant value if the content can be delivered async and the live components are mainly on discussion and connections."

I dug into who my members/audience are and they are mainly early entrepreneurs figuring out their presence on the Internet. Uncertainty and impostor syndrome are common among them. And posting a discussion topic on Circle is difficult for them because 1) it stays there forever and 2) it requires a thoughtful opener Most of them told me that they're part of some other Slack communities or for work. This means they can easily switch around to participate. For Circle, they need to visit a unique link and it becomes the last thing they remember to do"
