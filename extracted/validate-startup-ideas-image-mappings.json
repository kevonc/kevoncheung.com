Entrepreneurs have to keep generating ideas because you never know which one will stick. But the founding stories of these successful startups were oversimplified and glorified. Most of us would never hear about how many ideas and failed validations these founders had to go through in landing this one business model. What I want to talk about here: validation. In the last couple of years, mainly because of the Lean Startup movement, a lot of us founders are obsessed with"

Honestly, we had zero ideas about “the problem” and “the solution”. We ran about a dozen user interviews in the conference and exhibition space and we could see a trend emerging. Most organizers were searching for new technologies that could level up the attendee’s experience.

How I’d evaluate my future startup ideas (especially for B2B SaaS) 1. Is my idea part of a global trend? It is much better to ride with the wave than to go against it. Zapier played right in the global trend of booming Marketing Technology when it started in 2011. What did they do? They connected all these platforms.",
        "after": "Source: SaaS Marketer 2. Is the product easy to use? Can users self-onboard? This makes sure the rate of growth can be exponential. A product that raises the least confusing questions in the user’s mind wins. 3. Is it easy for people to tell their colleagues or friends? Can they try it out immediately? The moment right after “word of mouth”, when someone just hears about your product from another person, is the best time to capture interest. They should be able to try it out right away. 4. How long is the time to value or AHA moment? Can users use it in seconds, minutes, or days and weeks?"
