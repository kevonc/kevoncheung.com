        "after": "Back in March 2020, I was very active on my LinkedIn trying to engage my network. Soon I realized the engagement numbers weren’t moving at all. I spent some time looking at the best marketer I knew, Dave Gerhardt and studied how he did it. And I learned that it all came down to copywriting skills - which I sucked at. I was determined to get that fixed. Why you need to brush up your copywriting When you look at the best influencers in the world and how they drive thousands, if not hundreds, of engagements, it is always: can you relate to people quickly?"

And the best form of communication is still text, believe it or not. That’s where copywriting comes in. But a lot of us don’t take copywriting seriously because it is not easy to spot that you’re not good at it. As long as you can write, you can always produce something. But are people reading it? That’s the billion-dollar question.",
        "after": "Dave Gerhardt’s copywriting tactics on LinkedIn If you spend enough time in the marketing world, you must know Dave Gerhardt. He was the VP of Marketing at Drift and now CMO at Privy. He is amazing because he is very different from the other marketing leaders. And you know he is good by looking at his engagement metrics. So, how does he write on LinkedIn? He writes like he talks He is talking to a very clear audience His opening line is very short (8-16 words) He tells a story (even a personal one) He shares users’ success stories He uses bullet points He focuses on one hashtag only He injects personality and talks about unrelated things He posts consistently He speaks the annoying truth"

He writes like he talks To a lot of us, when we first write marketing copies, somehow we always go for a commercial, robotic type of tone as if that is the golden standard. Dave doesn’t do that. When you read his words, you feel that he is talking to you like a friend on the phone.",

Funny enough, by doing this, he naturally attracts other people. His opening line is short (8-16 words) I love to look at his 1st line. He tells a story (even a personal one) We all love reading a story because we’re nosy and we want to find out what happened. Daves always writes as if he is telling a quick bedtime story to his kids. He uses bullet points"
