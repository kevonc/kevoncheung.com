This is one of my biggest lessons in the last 2 years and I want to tell you how that happened and how you can avoid it. I don't know if you are the same. Basically when I'm figuring things out, I always look at who is successful at that thing and try to imitate . If you want a big YouTube channel, you should make videos like Mr Beast. If you want to be a knowledge creator, you should write a newsletter like Jay Clouse. If you want to be a successful creator, you should repurpose your content .... do a welcome sequence ... build out your value ladder."

There are a couple of points there but I want to highlight one here: At this point, I am allocating time to explore companies and projects I can join to play a meaningful part. Either full-time or contract base. Something that aligns with my interest in education, knowledge-sharing, and creation. Honestly, after 4 years of working solo, I crave working and collaborating with talented people. I had been in my own zone, and that's not healthy. As to having fun, I did something super random for fun:",
