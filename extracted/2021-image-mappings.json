I only knew: Because of COVID, lots of people were getting online I wasn’t interested in getting a job to build a resume At that point, I had absolutely nothing online too. No social media presence. No personal brand. No email list. But I was previously a top executive at 2 different startups, so I have tasted failures and know what it takes to navigate a new journey. “Why don’t I give this a try?” I told myself."

What I achieved in 2021 From Jan 1, 2021 to Dec 31, 2021: 🤗 Happiness & fulfillment from 5 to 9 👶 Baby from 0 to 1 🙌 Twitter followers from ~460 to 7.6k 📩 Email subscribers from 27 to 1.4k 🔧 Iterated 4 times on my BIP course 💸 Online revenue from $0 to $10k",
        "after": "My plan for 2021 was to make $20k for the entire year and reach $5k per month by Dec. I failed the 1st goal by making only $10k but I was close to my 2nd goal as I made $4.1k in Nov 2021. My feeling? The initial stage of being an online entrepreneur is difficult. Not only it is not an overnight success, but it is also impossible to achieve good enough success in the first year. This is especially true for a creator who needs a personal brand, credibility , and system in place in order to generate revenue."

What makes this journey extra challenging Lots of people ask me: You went all in to become a full-time creator and had a newborn at the same time? How did you do it? Ahh! I know. It wasn’t easy at all.",
        "after": "There were lots of moving parts. But what’s most important was designing a system ahead of time. For example: my wife left her full-time job, my parents-in-law have been extremely helpful, I had some savings from my previous startup jobs, etc. This system allowed me to stay focused on my entrepreneurial journey, meaning a good 6-7 hours on weekdays and 2 hours on weekend days. That’s a total of 34-39 hours a week! I was mindful about balancing the two and taking a slow approach to my business. I didn’t experience any burnout and I was enjoying everything. On a Zoom catch-up call with an university old friend, he even said “Kevon, you look really happy now!” That’s true."

So when I discovered “Build in Public”, not only did I feel connected to the topic, I also spotted an opportunity - lots of people wanted to do it but a quick Google search told me no one was there to help ( I talked about this journey in the video here ). I jumped in. In the graph below, you can see launching a free comprehensive 9-chapter Build in Public guide brought me 731 new followers in Feb 2021, doubling the number from 700 to 1.4k!",

It is crazy! In hindsight, this is exactly what growing a superfan base takes.

And then it got worse. In one of the live sessions, one student stayed behind. She said she wanted to chat more. She is one of the nicest people I’ve met online. At one point, she asked, “Kevon, do you want critical feedback from me?”"

But on the live sessions, because I was hesitant and always worried about how students were learning, she thought my authority dropped significantly. That wasn’t surprising feedback to me. After all, I’m a startup person, so I move fast and break things. I love to take action and get feedback. But, of course, it still hurt a little. And that’s when I made up my mind to level up my live facilitation skills which brought me to the Maven Course Accelerator in Sep 2021.",
        "after": "With in-depth knowledge about “Build in Public” after sharing for an entire year plus my improved facilitation skills, now I run my live sessions at Build in Public Mastery with much more confidence. I honestly don’t see any shortcut to this - everyone has to figure out their way to boost confidence and get rid of the self-doubts. Understanding how online businesses work I ran a B2B SaaS startup before as a first-time founder, so I knew a bit about how that business works. But to make a living as an online creator? I had zero knowledge."

Audience building is messing up what we know about business & marketing You can see my revenue chart above that I didn’t make a single dollar in my first 6 months. It was intentional because I knew my initial focus had to be on building up my name and credibility. Over time, I became accustomed to the creator mindset where I was present, generous, and helpful to everyone I met. I liked it because that’s how I live my life.",
        "after": "The challenge came when I started to monetize and build a business around my work. I had a difficult time balancing my approach. The creator’s audience-building mindset contradicted what was needed to grow the business: lead generation tactics, sales funnel, marketing campaigns, etc. Honestly, I’m still navigating how to strike a balance between the two. I still want to be present, generous, and helpful, but I also have a business to grow to make this worthwhile. Don’t ever copy & paste I believe in “steal like an artist” ."

At that point, I wasn’t sure it was my niche. I just knew that it felt right and I should give it a try. It was only months later when I still felt excited that I knew I’d stumbled upon my niche. Also, a big part of knowing it is your niche is about getting traction and recognition from other people. When people start respecting or looking up to you for a topic, you feel good, and that brings passion!",

Teach more than 105 students in 2022. Finish my book/course Find Joy in Chaos . It’ll be my biggest self-paced offering. Triple down on getting emails. Grow from 1.5k to 5k. Stop doing everything myself because I won’t achieve my goals alone. Start working with freelancers. Continue to kiss and love my family. They’re my biggest support on this journey."
