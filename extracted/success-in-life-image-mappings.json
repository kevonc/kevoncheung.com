        "after": "It was Thanksgiving, and I ordered two bottles of my favorite Ch'teau Léoville-Poyferré and wrote a card to send to a friend of mine. I don't actually enjoy gifting that much; I prefer catching up over coffee in person. But I wanted to do it this time. Because I genuinely wanted to say thank you to him. This man has taught me important lessons that I knew would have an impact on my entire life. I'm 30 this year, which means I've been working for 8 years. I've met and worked with many people, and that included top-level investors and CEOs fresh graduates, and even high school students."
