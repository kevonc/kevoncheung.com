Being an online solopreneur is VERY hard. You don't get to meet people in real life. A lot of your work is writing content, building products, and automating workflows. It can be quite a lonely path.

I paused the 30DaysInPublic course as I'm currently leveling up my skills in course design and teaching. I aim to build a course I can run 3-4 times a year and keep making it better for each cohort. I'm no longer charging a recurring membership fee for my Public Lab community. The decision comes from my shift of focus to be more course-driven. I want the community to be a supporting component instead of its own standalone product that charges members for a space to hang out."

The key difference is that students get to start and end at the same time, so it is focused on community-driven learning with accountability. After running a few cohort-based courses in the last few months, I wanted to skill up before I created my 2nd iteration of a Building in Public course. Now that I'm 1 of the 145 instructors out of 2,000 applicants at the Maven Course Accelerator."

Creating Showing Up Right in Public A cohort-based course usually comes with premium pricing because it is extremely resource-intensive. As a course creator, I could be spending my entire month running the course. So it is important to also work on products that people can consume on a self-paced basis. If you've taken a look at Public Lab's homepage , you'll know that I'm focused on helping other entrepreneurs and creators get through these 5 stages.",

I want this to become the go-to resource for anyone getting online and wants to follow the right steps. But, of course, there are still a lot of details for me to drill into. Come on! Stop dodging email marketing For the past 11 months, I've been collecting emails but I haven't done much with them. I always have this thought hovering in my mind that I don't want to be one of those people who send sales emails over and over again. Hence, I took a laid-back approach."

Instead of grinding and doing everything all the time, it is best to have seasons where you focus on different priorities. For me, 2021Q4 is definitely the product development season.
