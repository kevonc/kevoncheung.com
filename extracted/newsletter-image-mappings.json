        "after": "Last week I opened my inbox, and I saw more and more unread newsletters piling up. I decided it was time for at least half of them to go, so I started unsubscribing. I already had an automatic system to filter all the newsletters into different folders. This way I could only read them twice a week at dedicated times. But still, the situation was getting out of control. I simply didn't have the time to consume all this content. In the last year or so, newsletters have become the most popular channel to connect with an audience. The beauty is that you can own the distribution and go directly to the readers without relying on the algorithm of social media."
