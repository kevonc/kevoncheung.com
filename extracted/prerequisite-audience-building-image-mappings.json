        "after": "When it comes to audience building on Twitter, it comes down to producing high-quality content to attract readers. We call it - writing tweet threads to get followers. I've come across so many people who want to build an audience, but they either don't start or give up in a few weeks. At first, I thought it was because they didn't know how to write good tweets or tweet threads. But ever since I started running the #30DaysInPublic challenge, I found out they can all write. In fact, they can write well."

The things that are holding them back are accountability and consistency. Holding yourself accountable 8 years ago, I was trying to pick up coding myself. After 6 months of grinding online materials, I gave up and joined an in-person coding boot camp. I even flew all the way to New York to take it. Some people can hold themselves accountable and do self-learning, and some people cannot. This is how I see how we should approach learning.",
        "after": "Choosing between self-learning or cohort-based learning depends on your skills and experiences measured against the difficulty of what you're trying to learn. And the accountability line determines whether you'll be able to hold yourself accountable. For example, if you've been a software engineer for 10 years, then picking up React JS and Node JS should be something you can do yourself. But if you're a lawyer trying to learn how to build a community, it is likely you need a group of people to do it together, or else you'll give up quickly."

Not able to form a Twitter strategy Most people I talk to think Twitter is extra work. They understand the powerfulness of the social platform and the importance of growing an audience, but they fail to see Twitter as part of their business model. This is the biggest threat to your consistency. If you don't see it in your plan, how do you stick to it? I love mind mapping and I constantly revisit my business model on my online whiteboard. This is my marketing funnel at the moment.",
        "after": "Twitter is a beautiful platform with a high volume of users and activities. It is the perfect place as a top funnel to expose yourself to new people every week. This means you're consistently placing relevant high-quality content into the right people's hands. Then when they finally see your tweets or land on your profile, it is your chance to get them into your middle funnel. This could be your website, blog, newsletter , free courses, etc. This is where you do your best to communicate the values you can bring to this person."
