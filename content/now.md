## Being a present dad

I now have two daughters and I'm happy to say that my wife's and my life evolve around them. I'm a believer that **0-6 years old is the most precious period** because we get to help them develop the most, so we do everything we can to spend as much time with them.

Some things that we prioritize: **happiness, value, politeness, perspectives, and problem-solving skills**. I have a special project in mind that I'd love to work on with my wife and daughters. You can read more in the last point on this page.

## Exploring children's learning with AI & tech

Nothing gives me more joy than unlocking the potential in children. I had my first taste of it from 2015–2018 running a kids' coding school. Now that I’m a dad of two, I want to dive deeper into the world of children’s learning.

There’s so much we couldn’t do before. Now with AI, I believe we can finally do it. And I don’t just mean handing our kids an AI companion. We have to do better than that.

## Ideating Summer Worldschooling

I love the concept of worldschooling — **using the world as your classroom** — but I don't think we want to dive into it 100%. We still want to be in one place and attend a school.

BUT, I'm super keen on **exploring a Summer version!** I'd love my family to take 2-4 weeks every Summer to set and accomplish a mission in different parts of the world. It can be living on a farm, cycling through cities, exploring a country we've never heard of and talking to locals, etc.

It is about seeing the world from different perspectives. This is my biggest dream right now. Our kids are still young so we have time to think more about this. [I am sharing my ideas here.](http://summerworldschooling.com)

## Working on my golf

I've always loved sports that require a **high level of concentration** — beerpong (laugh!) darts, and archery. Now that the kids are no longer newborns, I think it is time for me to work on a new sport craft.

I picked up golf in Oct 2024 and I've been loving my self-learn journey so far!
