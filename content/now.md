Here you'll find out what I'm actively thinking about and working on. If you feel connected to something, feel free to reach out! This page was last updated on January 27, 2025.

## Being a present dad

I now have two daughters and I'm happy to say that my wife's and my life evolve around them. I'm a believer that **0-6 years old is the most precious period** because we get to help them develop the most, so we do everything we can to spend as much time with them.

Some things that we prioritize: **happiness, value, politeness, perspectives, and problem-solving skills**. I have a special project in mind that I'd love to work on with my wife and daughters. You can read more in the last point on this page.

## Collaborating with more people

I've been running a one-man online education business since 2021. It was the dream business for a new dad during a global pandemic. But things have changed.

"Working" is dynamic these days. You don't have to just do one thing. I'd love opportunities to challenge myself to go beyond what I'm capable of. **I crave learning and collaborating with talented people**. I'm always ears for exciting new projects.

## Exploring the next phase of digital learning

I've been impressed with what AI can do, especially in building micro software and tools. I can see AI revolutionizing the way we teach and learn. I see a bright future where we use more game play activities to make learning fun and engaging, but I don't mean gamification.

## Sorting out Summer Worldschooling

I love the concept of worldschooling — **using the world as your classroom** — but I don't think we want to dive into it 100%. We still want to be in one place and attend a school.

BUT, I'm super keen on **exploring a Summer version!** I'd love my family to take 2-4 weeks every Summer to set and accomplish a mission in different parts of the world. It can be living on a farm, cycling through cities, exploring a country we've never heard of and talking to locals, etc.

It is about seeing the world from different perspectives. This is my biggest dream right now. Our kids are still young so we have time to think more about this. [I am sharing my ideas here.](http://summerworldschooling.com)

## Picking up golf

I've always loved sports that require a **high level of concentration** — beerpong (laugh!) darts, and archery. Now that the kids are no longer newborns, I think it is time for me to work on a new sport craft.

I took golf lessons when I was 20 but never really played much ever since. It is time to pick it up again.
