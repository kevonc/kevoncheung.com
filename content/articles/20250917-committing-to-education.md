**TL;DR:**

1. Why I stopped working on StoryPal
2. Where I see the world heading (so I'm heading there)
3. What happens to the Public Lab newsletter (what should you do?)

## StoryPal

In May 2025, I shared that I was working on an app to help you craft stories.

I've launched it to a group of beta users. I've self-tested a ton. And now, I'm shutting down the project.

One reason is that it is just so hard to get a story right. Storytelling is more art than science. StoryPal can be a great guide, but the value it delivers to users is not entirely clear.

How does one judge whether a story is good or bad? It is very subjective. I don't like this fact for an app. Without a clear value within control, I don't think it can go far.

Also, well, my heart has changed.

## The future reimagined beyond 2025

As I use AI more and more in brainstorming, structuring my words, and now even building apps, I keep thinking about what the world will look like in ten years.

I'm someone who follows my heart all the time. When I studied Finance in university, I didn't go on to get a Finance job. I asked myself - what truly energizes me? It was building things on the web, which I've done since I was 13. And so I learned coding and became a software engineer.

I've been reflecting in the same way throughout my entire career - where exactly is my heart? What am I curious about now? What do I feel energized doing?

At this point in my life, I have 2 daughters. I have a math educator wife. I feel alive being with children who are curious and interested (I volunteered at a Summer Camp last month). I take a telescope to look deep into my heart, and everything is pointing me toward exploring children's growth and learning (under ten years old).

I also know that the future of education will look drastically different with the rise of AI. I read [Brave New Words by Salman Khan](https://amzn.to/3IrD2B0) to check out his views.

I can imagine every student getting a personalized roadmap and a ton more feedback. I can see that teachers being empowered to mentor because they will be less bothered by admin tasks. I can see parents making learning fun and rewarding because it is possible to incorporate what the kid is interested in.

I know that soft skills like critical thinking, emotional intelligence, leadership, and collaborative problem-solving will be the new currency, not technical, hard skills.

When I look at my daughters, I see so many things we parents have to invest time in:

* Finding out their strengths, weaknesses, interests, and personalities
* Figuring out the right approach to schooling
* Filling gaps the school can't address
* Finding ways to develop character
* Searching for space so children can be children and play
* Self-reflecting on how to run a family
* More

So much will and must change in education and learning. Oh, just thinking about all of this energizes me! A lot! If you have friends in this space, please introduce me to them. I'd love to learn about what they do and say hi.

As for how I'm going to build a business around this to make it a sustainable effort? I have no idea!

I have been working on my first project for the last few weeks. I call it FunSheets. It is a worksheet generator that turns one keyword into a full-blown worksheet for kids aged 2-6 with Chinese vocabulary, English sentences, and math problems.

My wife, Lydia, made them manually for our elder daughter, Avery, and she absolutely loves these sheets. So I thought ... why not turn it into an app to let other parents use it with their children?

It is a mini step towards that personalized learning future. I'm quite proud of this creation!

With this new direction, I'm thinking about the future of this newsletter that you've subscribed to.

## The Public Lab newsletter

I've been running a brand called Public Lab since 2021.

I appreciate my readers a lot. Some might have been reading my words for years or for a few days. I just feel amazed that the internet can introduce me to people worldwide.

This is also what motivated me to start sharing out loud for 5 years straight. I can say that I'm addicted to connecting with people via sharing. These days, I'm trying out different ways to [express myself on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/kevon/).

It's been fun. It is impossible to know what you enjoy or what your audience likes until you take time to try things out. I recommend not boxing yourself in too early.

Going forward, I imagine myself sharing more about kids' growth and learning in the AI world, and I still want to talk about my learnings and journey in a casual, irregular way.

You can find these sharing on this website or [my newsletter](https://kevoncheung.substack.com/).

I will not write much about audience building, marketing, building in public, running an online business, etc. This chapter has left my heart.

All excited for the new chapter - education and learning for kids!
