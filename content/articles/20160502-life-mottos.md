There are so many life mottos out there from all these famous people; for me, I believe everyone should have a personal set of life mottos and it is worth writing them down so we can remind ourselves from time to time.

From reflecting on my early career, these are the 7 ones that shaped me into who I am.

If you can't do the small things well, don't mind the big things

Never be late

Be humble, there are a lot of people smarter than you

Early birds get the worms

If you cannot decide for yourself, no one can

Don't look back, look forward

Hard work will pay off, just be patient
