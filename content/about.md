Hi! I'm Kevon. I grew up in Hong Kong and spent 7 years studying in the U.S. around the Boston area. Then I was in New York and Singapore for a short time. Now I'm back home in Hong Kong. I've been building and sharing things online since I was 12 years old. Let's just say I've enjoyed the impact and connections I'm able to make. You can check out [what I'm doing now](/now) if you're curious.

## üåÖ Life Making

Life is all about connecting the dots.

While I majored in Entrepreneurship and Finance, my heart has always been in technology since young. So fresh out of university, I spent the Summer learning how to code and got my first job as a software engineer in Singapore. I hopped on the plane and relocated myself in 4 days. After one year, I realized I didn't want to be typing on the keyboard all day (Yup, before AI showed up, that was normal).

Coincidentally, a founder reached out and I went on to spend four years expanding her kids coding school across Asia. I never imagined I would be interested in education, but saying yes ended up changing the entire trajectory of my life. After that, I spent two years leading a funded startup building software for online teaching and facilitating.

During COVID in 2020, I took a big step into writing and teaching online myself. I wrote a guide that [went sort of viral](/bip-guide-behind-the-scenes). With an audience, I dedicated myself to teaching them [how to build in public](https://www.smallschool.is/build-in-public). I started Public Lab and later rebranded it into [Small School](https://smallschool.is).

The dots have connected me to entrepreneurship, business, coding, education, teaching, and learning. Now these are the things I deeply care about.

## üè° My Family

Just like education, I also never imagined myself being a family-oriented person. I'm thinking these are the things that grow on you as you age.

Lydia and I met in 2016. I often joke that it was "wife at first sight". I was at that stage of my life and the right person showed up. We got married in 2019 and now live a busy life with our two daughters. 

I love spending a tremendous amount of time with my family - the bonding, growing, and enriching. I find human growth to be quite fascinating because it is not linear and straightforward, maybe that's why I'm drawn to learning and parenting.

We're just a simple family prioritizing happiness and basic values.

## üèåÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Hobbies

I love trying new things, but I haven't gotten to a point where I'm obsessed with one thing.

I like to run - flat or trail. I like to play tennis and now golf too. I enjoy the precision game and the ability to get fresh air and socialize.
