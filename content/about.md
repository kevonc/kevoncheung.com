I'm the founder of [Small School](https://smallschool.io), helping people productize their knowledge into digital products.

Previously, I was the CEO at First Code Academy, where we taught kids to code across Asia. Before that, I was a software engineer at Oursky, building mobile apps for startups and enterprises.

My professional career started in software engineering. I graduated from The University of Hong Kong with a Computer Science degree. I've always been passionate about education and entrepreneurship, which led me to start teaching coding and eventually building education businesses.
