# Hey! I'm Kevon ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my personal site.

I enjoy exploring new ideas around business, education, marketing and knowledge sharing. When I realized everyone has the power to share what they know, I started [Small School](https://smallschool.io).

I now live in Hong Kong with my wife and two daughters. I like to run, write, and do silly things with my girls.

Here you'll find my writing and projects. I try my best to show you what I'm learning. Follow me so we can be friends:

## I Share

I love sharing what I know. I call myself the "open book". Here you can find some of the best talks or interviews I've done.

## I Create

### Small School

I believe everyone has something to teach. I build this school to share with you how to **productize what you know into digital products to make a side income.**

### Find Joy in Chaos

I wrote a book to show you how to **build a powerful online presence and community** even if you are starting from absolutely nothing.

### Our Parenting Playbook

Why do startups have "culture & values" playbook but families don't? Since my 1st daughter was born, I've been noting down **key principles that guide our family forward.**

### Summer Worldschooling

I love worldschooling â€” to "use the world as your classroom", but I'm not going to travel full-time. This is a fun project to **compile a list of Summer ideas so all families can enjoy.**
